# <font color="maroon">Welcome</font>


**Data Science for Absolute Beginners** is a free online program designed for busy professionals who want to learn data science quickly and efficiently. Unlike most offerings, the workshops and course sessions combine self-paced material with live interactive sessions. The course design is based on principles of active learning. Our goal is to teach you practical data science skills that can be applied in a variety of professions.
